    "revised_reasoning": " SUMMARY:\nSummary for 2018-03-21:\n- Usage_kWh: Average daily energy consumption is approximately 37.30 kWh, with a maximum peak of 95.54 kWh and a minimum trough of 3.20 kWh. This indicates a consistent pattern of energy use with occasional spikes.\n- Lagging_Current_Reactive.Power_kVarh: The average reactive power during the lagging current is 14.34 kVarh, ranging from 0.00 to 60.30 kVarh. This implies that there may be some inefficiencies in the system due to a slight mismatch between the electrical load and the supply voltage waveform.\n- Leading_Current_Reactive_Power_kVarh: The average reactive power during the leading current is 1.55 kVarh, with a maximum of 26.17 kVarh and a minimum of 0.00 kVarh. This suggests that there is less potential for inefficiencies compared to lagging current, but further investigation may be required.\n- CO2(tCO2): The average carbon dioxide emission is 0.02, with a maximum of 0.04 and a minimum of 0.00. This indicates a low environmental impact from the electrical system.\n- Lagging_Current_Power_Factor: The power factor during lagging current is on average 82.38%, with a maximum of 100.00% and a minimum of 55.94%. This suggests that the efficiency of the system could potentially be improved by reducing the lagging load.\n- Leading_Current_Power_Factor: The power factor during leading current is on average 96.58%, with a maximum of 100.00% and a minimum of 24.42%. This indicates that the system is operating efficiently in terms of leading current, but there may still be room for further optimization.\n\nLoad Type Distribution:\n- Light_Load: 41.67% of the total load consists of light loads.\n- Medium_Load: 33.33% of the total load is medium loads.\n- Maximum_Load: 25.00% of the total load represents maximum loads. This suggests that the system is well balanced, with a mix of various types and sizes of loads.\n\nACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. Analyze the system to identify the sources of the inefficiencies related to the lagging current reactive power (Lagging_Current_Reactive.Power_kVarh). This could involve adjusting the phase angle or improving the power factor.\n2. Consider implementing load management strategies to reduce the lagging load and improve the overall efficiency of the system, as suggested by the low Lagging_Current_Power_Factor.\n3. Monitor the leading current reactive power (Leading_Current_Reactive_Power_kVarh) to ensure it remains within optimal levels, and take action if necessary to maintain efficiency.\n4. Continue to monitor carbon dioxide emissions (CO2(tCO2)) to assess the environmental impact of the electrical system and look for ways to further minimize emissions if possible.\n5. The load distribution is well balanced, so no immediate changes are needed in this regard. However, it is important to keep an eye on any future shifts in the load composition to maintain a balanced system."

    "reasoning": " {\n  \"maintenance_needed\": \"Yes\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The reactive power values for both Lagging and Leading Current show maximum readings that are significantly higher than the average, particularly in the case of Lagging Current (81.94 kVarh vs 13.35 kVarh avg). This could indicate an issue with the plant's electrical system or equipment.\",\n  \"energy_optimization_suggestions\": \"Given that the Power Factors are relatively low (avg around 85), it suggests that the plant may not be operating at its full efficiency. To optimize energy usage, consider implementing power factor correction capacitors to improve operational efficiency and reduce energy costs.\"\n}"

    "revised_reasoning": " SUMMARY for January 18, 2018:\n- Usage_kWh: Average consumption was 76.60 kWh per day, with a peak of 149.65 kWh and a minimum of 7.74 kWh.\n- Lagging_Current_Reactive_Power_kVarh: The average reactive power lagged at 36.36 kVarh, peaking at 84.89 kVarh with no recorded minima.\n- Leading_Current_Reactive_Power_kVarh: The average leading reactive power was 1.09 kVarh, with a maximum of 26.06 kVarh and a minimum of 0 kVarh.\n- CO2(tCO2): The average daily CO2 emission was 0.04 kg, with a peak of 0.07 kg and no recorded minima.\n- Lagging_Current_Power_Factor: The average power factor while lagging was 87.94%, peaking at 100% and having a minimum of 76.91%.\n- Leading_Current_Power_Factor: The average leading power factor was 97.65%, with a maximum of 100% and a minimum of 28.71%.\n\nLoad Type Distribution:\n- Light_Load: Approximately 41.67% of the load was light load.\n- Medium_Load: About 33.33% of the load was medium load.\n- Maximum_Load: The remaining 25.00% represented maximum load.\n\nIMPROVED REASONING:\nBy analyzing the energy consumption data for January 18, 2018, it is clear that there was a significant daily average usage of 76.6 kWh, with a range between 7.74 and 149.65 kWh. This indicates consistent energy consumption patterns throughout the day, though some fluctuations were observed.\n\nThe reactive power data shows an average lagging value of 36.36 kVarh and a maximum of 84.89 kVarh. Interestingly, there was no recorded minimum for this category, suggesting that the system may have operated in this mode throughout the day. The leading reactive power had an average of 1.09 kVarh with a maximum of 26.06 kVarh and no observed minima, hinting at occasional but relatively brief instances where this was in effect.\n\nIn terms of emissions, the daily average CO2 emission was 0.04 kg, with a peak of 0.07 kg. This suggests that the system emitted a moderate amount of CO2 during operation on this day.\n\nThe power factor data reveals an average lagging power factor of 87.94% and a leading power factor of 97.65%. These values indicate an overall efficient system, with some slight deviations in the power factors throughout the day. However, it is important to note that the maximum power factor for both modes reached 100%, which signifies perfect power factor operation at specific instances during the day.\n\nFinally, the load type distribution shows that light loads accounted for approximately 41.67% of the total load, followed by medium loads with a share of about 33.33%. The remaining 25.00% represents maximum loads, indicating periods of high energy consumption throughout the day.\n\nOverall, the data shows that the system operated efficiently, emitting moderate amounts of CO2 while maintaining consistent energy consumption patterns. The significant peaks and valleys in certain categories suggest occasional fluctuations or brief instances where certain operational modes were in effect. Further analysis can be performed to identify any trends or anomalies in this data."

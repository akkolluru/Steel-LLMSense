    "reasoning": " {\n  \"maintenance_needed\": \"Yes\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The low power factors for both lagging and leading current suggest that there might be issues with the power system's efficiency. The low value for Leading_Current_Power_Factor (24.51) indicates a severe inefficiency, which could be due to motor loads, transformers or capacitor banks malfunction. The high value for Lagging_Current_Power_Factor (61.77) also indicates an issue that might affect the stability and reliability of the electrical system.\",\n  \"energy_optimization_suggestions\": \"Given the high energy usage (Avg = 27.73 kWh), it is recommended to implement a power monitoring system for load balancing, especially during Maximum_Load periods. Additionally, optimizing motor efficiencies and ensuring proper maintenance of transformers can help reduce energy consumption.\"\n}"

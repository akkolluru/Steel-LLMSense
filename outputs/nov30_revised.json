    "revised_reasoning": " SUMMARY:\nSummary for 2018-11-30:\n- Usage_kWh: The average daily energy consumption was approximately 27.73 kWh, with a maximum peak of 73.26 kWh and a minimum usage of 3.28 kWh.\n- Lagging_Current_Reactive.Power_kVarh: The average reactive power lagging over the day was 11.68 kVarh, reaching a maximum of 47.52 kVarh and never dropping below 0 kVarh.\n- Leading_Current_Reactive_Power_kVarh: The average leading reactive power was 2.16 kVarh, with a maximum of 21.64 kVarh and a minimum value of 0 kVarh.\n- CO2(tCO2): The average CO2 emission for the day was 0.01, with a daily maximum of 0.03 and a minimum of 0.00.\n- Lagging_Current_Power_Factor: The average power factor lagging over the day was 84.73%, with a maximum of 100% and a minimum value of 61.77%.\n- Leading_Current_Power_Factor: The average leading power factor for the day was 93.26%, reaching a maximum of 100% and a minimum of 24.51%.\n\nLoad Type Distribution:\n- Light_Load: Approximately 41.67% of the load consisted of light loads.\n- Medium_Load: About 33.33% of the load was medium in nature.\n- Maximum_Load: The remaining 25.00% was maximum load.\n\nREVISED REASONING:\nThe data presented for 2018-11-30 suggests that energy consumption peaked at 73.26 kWh with an average daily usage of approximately 27.73 kWh. The reactive power lagged over the day, averaging 11.68 kVarh and reaching a maximum of 47.52 kVarh. Leading reactive power had an average of 2.16 kVarh and never dropped below 0 kVarh. CO2 emissions were minimal, with an average of 0.01 and a maximum of 0.03 for the day. Both lagging and leading power factors showed significant variation, with the former having an average of 84.73% and the latter an average of 93.26%. The load distribution indicates that light loads constituted approximately 41.67%, medium loads accounted for about 33.33%, and maximum loads made up the remaining 25.00%.\n\nIn summary, the data shows that energy consumption was relatively high on this day, with a diverse load distribution. The reactive power lagged throughout the day, contributing to potential inefficiencies in the system. Emissions were minimal, but efforts should be made to further reduce them. Lastly, the power factors indicate room for improvement in power efficiency."
